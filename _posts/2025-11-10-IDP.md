I completed my Interdisciplinary Project (IDP) at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** during my master’s 
studies. In this program, informatics students like me collaborated with other departments to contribute our technical 
expertise to cross-disciplinary research projects. My project explored how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and 
**Virtual Reality (VR)** can be used together to teach **cultural heritage**.

## 📘 Abstract

In this project, we integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into a Virtual Reality (VR) quiz game setting for Intangible
Cultural Heritage (ICH) education, emphasizing the potential of using AI in a VR as a collaborative game master
to foster multicultural education. Centered around the Chinese New Year celebration, a multiplayer VR game
has been developed to enhance multicultural understanding through immersive, competitive and collaborative
experiences. The novelty lies in utilizing an adaptive AI chatbot, powered by Large Language Models (LLM), to
serve as a dynamic cultural quiz master. This chatbot provides information on cultural context, facilitates in-game
communication, and adapts to user interactions. This project focuses on the technical implementation of adaptive
AI in VR, detailing the development challenges, AI integration strategies, and the anticipated impact on cultural
education. Highlighting the synergy between VR and AI, it aims to offer new insights for AI-assisted learning within
virtual collaborative spaces.

## 🎮 QuizCraft — The Quiz & Decoration Game

The game combines a **quiz** and **decoration** mechanic. It runs in **VR** and is **multiplayer**, requiring two 
players to collaborate. At several points in the game loop, the NPC uses **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and 
**ChatGPT + Speech-to-Text (STT)** for dynamic, AI-driven dialogue.

The objective is to **decorate a living room** with cultural elements related to the **Chinese New Year**. Below is an 
example of a room **before** and **after** decoration:

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/scene_room_empty.png" alt="Before" width="100%"/>
  <br>
  <em>Before</em>
  <br><br>
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/scene_room_decorated.png" alt="After" width="100%"/>
  <br>
  <em>After</em>
</div>

To get a better feeling of the game, here’s the NPC’s **scripted dialogue** where it explains the game:

<div align="center">
  <video width="100%" controls>
    <source src="/assets/img/IDP/DecoratioRoomExplanation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>

## 🔁 Game Loop

The final **game loop** of quizzing, talking & decorating is visualized below:

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/game_idea.png" alt="Game Loop" width="100%"/>
</div>

Each round, players split up and enter separate **quiz rooms**, where they learn about a cultural object and then answer a question about it.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/quiz_room_a.png" alt="Quiz Room" width="100%"/>
</div>

Afterward, players meet in the **summary hall** to explain what they learned to each other. 
The NPC listens using **STT**, then uses **ChatGPT** to evaluate and provide feedback 
using **TTS** on their explanations. Once the discussion is complete, a **totem** representing the 
object appears in the room.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/summary_hall_a.png" alt="Summary Hall" width="40%"/>
</div>

When the explanation step is done, the **objects are unlocked** as decoration elements for the living room. Players can 
therefore use these to decorate the scene.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/IDP/objects_room_a.png" alt="Objects Room" width="70%"/>
</div>

Repeating this loop several times results in a fully decorated living room. The goal is to make 
**learning about cultural objects** engaging by:  
1. Reading & quizzing about them 
2. Explaining them to another player(and receiving AI feedback)  
3. Decorating a room with the new items  

This blend of **quizzing, dialogue, and creativity** helps players explore cultural heritage in a fun, interactive way
with the emphasis on repetition and stimulation through reading, speaking and placing.
