During my two years at [MVZ Martinsried](https://www.medicover-diagnostics.de/genetische-beratung/unsere-beratungsstandorte/martinsried) as a working student, I mainly developed Python scripts for process automation and quality-of-life improvements. One project I’d like to highlight is a **Python library** I built for creating dynamic LaTeX-based forms, allowing fully formatted PDF documents to be generated with just a few lines of code.

## 📘 Example

This example demonstrates how the library **provides examples** for images, tables, hyperlinks, code blocks, barcodes, text boxes, and more. 
It also **defines standards** for fonts, colors, headers, footers, positioning, and other layout elements. 
Using this comprehensive example, many reports were designed and generated automatically through code.

## 🏗️ How the Library Works

The library was structured around three main components:

1. **`example.tex`** - a LaTeX document defining the content structure.  
2. **`format.sty`** - a style file specifying standardized rules for fonts, colors, tables, headers, footers, images, table of contents etc..  
3. **`python methods`** - functions to dynamically insert data into the `.tex` file.

The workflow was designed to be **minimal and intuitive**:

- **1 line** to open the `template.tex`.  
- **1 line** to render it as a `.pdf`.  
- **1 line** to insert an object e.g. text, images or tables.  

The library also supported logic for replacing placeholders in the LaTeX template with real data, making it easy to
fill the form via code.
