I did my interdisciplinary project (IDP) at the TUM during my masters studies. Here informatics such as I was
are offered as workforce to push technical projects on non-informatic chairs of the university. In my case, I joined
a team at the [Chair for Human-Centered Technologies for Learning](https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/hctl/home/).
