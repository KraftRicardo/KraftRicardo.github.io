Hello Stranger, my name is Ricardo, and welcome to my **portfolio** page! 
Here, I showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on throughout my studies and personal time.

About me, I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), focusing on practical, hands-on courses with plenty of opportunities to code. 
For my Master’s thesis, I worked on optimizing a [query engine for faster performance]({% post_url 2025-11-11-Master-Thesis %}), and I also developed a **virtual-reality-based** [game]({% post_url 2025-11-10-IDP %}) environment featuring **AI-supported** NPC interactions.

In my spare time, I love developing games, it’s one of my biggest passions. 
I even built my own [2D RPG engine]({% post_url 2025-11-12-2D-RPG-Engine %}) from scratch and participated in [three Game Jams]({% post_url 2025-11-08-Gamejam %}) during my studies. The RPG engine is by far my most ambitious personal project, and if you only have time to look at one thing, that’s the one I’d recommend!

I also gained two years of professional experience at [MVZ Martinsried](https://www.medicover-diagnostics.de/genetische-beratung/unsere-beratungsstandorte/martinsried), working mostly in the Bioinformatics department. 
There, I primarily used Python for scripting, automation, and various quality-of-life improvements to support the team’s workflows.
You can see one example on the post I made about [Form Automation]({% post_url 2025-11-09-Form-Library %})

At the moment, I’m looking for opportunities as a **junior software developer**, ideally at a company that values learning, collaboration, and growth. 
If you’re interested, please don’t hesitate to reach out via the **Contact** section of this website.

Have a wonderful day!
