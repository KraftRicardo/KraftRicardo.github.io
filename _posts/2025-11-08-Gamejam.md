I’ve participated in three [Semester Game Jams](https://sgj.itch.io/) hosted by TUM. 
The challenge is to build a game in 48h given a topic word. In each jam, our teams used the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/) to build our games.
Back then, I mainly contributed as a level designer and sprite artist, writing only a little bit of code since I was still new to programming.
Nonetheless, I’d like to share each of the games we made!

## 🎮 Game Jam #1 – Huge & Cute

**Huge & Cute** is a puzzle game where you control two characters simultaneously.  
To progress to the next level, you need to press both buttons at the same time. The theme of the jam was **Cycle**, 
and we were thrilled to take **3rd place**! It’s a short game - give it a try! 😄

## 🎮 Game Jam #2 – Penguins Can’t Fly

In **Penguins Can’t Fly**, up to four players each control a penguin falling down a cliff, competing against one another as they descend.
The theme for this jam was **Depth**.

## 🎮 Game Jam #3 – The Stop Sign Revolution

This was for the [Semester Game Jam WS 2022](https://itch.io/jam/sgjws2022), where the theme was **Make it Stop**.  
Our team created **The Stop Sign Revolution**, a chaotic multiplayer game for up to four players, where each player controls a runaway stop sign rampaging through a city and smashing cars.
